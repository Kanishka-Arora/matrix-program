# matrix-program
This C++ program performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two square matrices (up to 10x10) using a menu-driven approach. The user enters the matrix size and elements, then selects an operation from the menu. Based on the choice, the program calculates and displays the result. The loop continues until the user selects "Exit".
